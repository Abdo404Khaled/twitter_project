## Project Structure
src/main/java/com/twitterapp/
├── DataManager/
├── Interfaces/
├── Models/
├── App.java

## Directory Structure Explanation

- **src/main/java/com/twitterapp/:**
  - This is the main source code directory for the Java application.
  - `com` is a convention for the root package name, and `twitterapp` is the specific package name for the application.
  - Within this directory, there are subpackages (`DataManager`, `Interfaces`, `Models`) representing different components or modules of the application.

- **DataManager/**, **Interfaces/**, **Models/**:
  - These directories contain different components or modules of the Java application, each organized by functionality.
  - For example, `DataManager`  handles data processing, `Interfaces` contains interfaces defining contracts, and `Models` contains data models.

- **App.java:**
  - This is the main application file.
  - It contains the main entry point for the application.

## Notes

- Ensure the input dataset file is present in the same directory as the compiled Java program.
Customize the program as needed to adapt to specific dataset formats or processing requirements.
